Cultivation and Magic: A Survivor's Guide to Not Dying Horribly
The Beautiful Lie They Tell You
So you want to learn about cultivation and magic? Adorable. Let me paint you a picture of what you're really signing up for, because the recruitment brochures always leave out the part where your organs liquify and leak out through your pores.

Cultivation - that's the fancy word for "absorbing cosmic energy until you either transcend mortality or explode into chunky salsa." It's sold as this noble path of self-improvement, like yoga for people who want to eventually punch holes through mountains. What they don't mention is that the process involves systematically breaking down every cell in your body and rebuilding it with raw magical energy that has all the subtlety of molten plutonium.

The Energy That Wants to Kill You
Magic exists because the System decided your reality was too boring and needed more ways for people to die creatively. It manifests as this invisible field of energy - call it mana, chi, ether, or "Steve" for all the System cares - that permeates everything like cosmic radiation, except instead of giving you cancer, it gives you the ability to set things on fire with your mind. Usually starting with yourself.

This energy is everywhere, flowing through the air, the ground, your morning coffee, and that annoying coworker who always microwaves fish in the office kitchen. The trick - and oh, what a delightful trick it is - involves learning to absorb this energy without having it cook you from the inside out like a particularly vindictive microwave.

The Manuals: Your Death Instruction Guide
Enter the cultivation manuals - those helpful little guidebooks written by people who survived long enough to share their wisdom. These range from "Basic Body Hardening for Idiots" to "Advanced Soul Destruction Techniques" and everything in between. They're graded from G to A, just like your potential lifespan, which is a fun little coincidence that definitely doesn't foreshadow anything ominous.

G-grade manuals are like training wheels made of bubble wrap - they might keep you from dying immediately, but they're not going to help you when someone starts throwing fireballs at your face. These teach you basic energy absorption, usually through meditation techniques that involve sitting very still while cosmic forces slowly rewire your internal organs. The mortality rate is only about thirty percent, which the authors consider a rousing success.

A-grade manuals, on the other hand, are basically suicide notes written by gods. They contain cultivation techniques so advanced that reading them incorrectly can cause spontaneous combustion, temporal displacement, or worse - enlightenment. These bad boys can turn you into a walking natural disaster, assuming you survive the first chapter without having your soul torn apart by conflicting energy patterns.

The Grades: Your Descent Into Beautiful Madness
G-Grade (Completely Fucked): You're still basically human, which means you're still basically dead meat. You can maybe sense energy if you concentrate really hard and squint. Your lifespan hasn't changed much - still a pathetic century if you're lucky. This is where most people start and many people end, usually in small, smoking pieces.

F-Grade (Slightly Less Fucked): Congratulations! You can now absorb energy without immediately dying. You've doubled your lifespan to a whopping 250 years, assuming something doesn't eat you first. You can probably enhance your physical abilities enough to arm-wrestle a bear and only lose three limbs instead of four.

E-Grade (The Sweet Spot of Mediocrity): You've reached the minimum viable cultivation level - 500 years to contemplate all the ways you can still die horribly. This is where most Tutorial graduates end up, having learned just enough magic to be dangerous to themselves and annoying to others. You can throw basic spells, enhance your body to superhuman levels, and occasionally not die when stabbed.

D-Grade (Getting Interesting): A thousand years of life, assuming you don't do something stupid like challenge a C-grade cultivator to a duel. At this level, you're starting to understand that the energy you've been absorbing isn't just fuel - it's actively rewriting the fundamental nature of your existence. Your body is no longer entirely human; it's becoming something that can survive having its blood replaced with liquid lightning.

C-Grade (Officially Terrifying): Ten thousand years stretches before you like an eternity of making increasingly poor life choices. You've transcended most human limitations and can now destroy city blocks with a sneeze. The energy coursing through your body has transformed you into something that makes normal humans weep in your presence - not from awe, but from their survival instincts screaming that they're standing next to an apex predator.

B-Grade (Cosmic Horror): A hundred thousand years of existence, most of which you'll spend trying to remember what it felt like to be human. At this point, calling you "human" is like calling a hydrogen bomb a "firecracker." You've become a living violation of several laws of physics, and reality bends around you like it's apologizing for getting in your way.

A-Grade (Barely Distinguishable from God): A million years of life, assuming the universe doesn't collapse first from the sheer weight of your existence. You've transcended mortality so completely that death has become more of a mild inconvenience than an actual threat. The energy you've absorbed has transformed you into something that makes lesser beings spontaneously develop new religions just by existing in their general vicinity.

The Beautiful Irony
Here's the cosmic joke that nobody tells you upfront: the higher you climb in cultivation, the less human you become. Each grade isn't just a power increase - it's a step away from everything you once were. The energy that grants you immortality slowly burns away your humanity like acid eating through silk.

You start this journey thinking you're improving yourself, making yourself stronger, better, more capable. What you're actually doing is systematically replacing every aspect of your identity with raw cosmic force until what's left couldn't be called "you" by any reasonable definition. You become powerful beyond imagination, but the person who wanted that power died somewhere around D-grade, dissolved into the energy they thought they were controlling.

The cultivation manuals don't mention this part. They focus on the techniques, the power, the immortality - all the flashy benefits that make the whole process sound appealing. They skip over the part where you wake up one day and realize you can't remember what your mother's laugh sounded like, or why you used to enjoy the taste of chocolate, or what it felt like to care about anything smaller than galactic politics.

The Tools of Your Transformation
Beyond the manuals, there are magical items - weapons, armor, pills, artifacts - all graded according to the same system that measures your inevitable descent into cosmic indifference. These items are imbued with the same energy you're absorbing, concentrated and refined into forms that can enhance your cultivation or kill you more efficiently.

A G-grade sword might be sharp enough to cut through steel. An A-grade sword exists in seventeen dimensions simultaneously and can sever concepts as easily as flesh. The difference isn't just power - it's a fundamental shift in what "weapon" even means.

Using items above your grade is like trying to perform surgery with a nuclear warhead - technically possible, but the collateral damage tends to include your continued existence. The energy backlash from a single A-grade pill can turn a D-grade cultivator into a brief but spectacular light show, complete with screaming.

The Cosmic Punchline
The System set all this up knowing exactly what would happen. It created a progression system that turns every success into a small death, every advancement into a step away from the humanity you're trying to preserve. It's breeding gods through a process that destroys everything that makes gods worth worshipping.

And the beautiful part? Nobody makes you do it. Every step of cultivation is a choice. Every manual you read, every technique you practice, every boundary you cross - it's all voluntary. The System just sits back and watches as entire civilizations willingly dissolve themselves into cosmic energy, one grade at a time.

Because in the end, that's what cultivation really is: the most elaborate suicide method ever devised, disguised as self-improvement and sold with a smile. You either die quick and human, or live long enough to become something that wouldn't recognize its former self in a mirror.

Welcome to magic. Try not to explode.
