The Incursion Stage - or as I like to call it, "Congratulations on Surviving Tutorial! Now Here's Your Real Exam: Preventing Cosmic Colonialism."

See, while you've been busy learning to cast your first magic missile without blowing off your own eyebrows, the rest of the multiverse has been eyeing your little planet like a particularly juicy real estate listing. "Charming fixer-upper! Primitive natives! Untapped resources! Must see to believe!"

The moment that Tutorial Stage clock starts ticking, it's open season on your world. Factions start dropping outposts like cosmic dog turds, each one a beachhead for what amounts to the most polite invasion in multiversal history. And by polite, I mean they follow the System's rules about grade restrictions - can't have B-grade demigods showing up on day one to turn your capital cities into modern art installations.

Year one? They're limited to F-grade colonists - basically the multiversal equivalent of unpaid interns with delusions of grandeur. These are the expendable losers who volunteered for frontier duty because they couldn't hack it in established territories. They show up with basic gear, modest magical abilities, and the desperate hunger of middle management trying to prove they deserve a promotion.

But here's where it gets deliciously fucked up: there are quadrillions of beings out there looking for their slice of paradise, and your newly-magicked world looks like prime real estate. These aren't just random adventurers seeking fortune - these are entire civilizations of refugees, economic migrants, second sons, and ambitious sociopaths who see your planet as their ticket to a better life.

Every year that passes, the grade restrictions lift another notch. Year two brings E-grade colonists with centuries of experience. Year three? D-grade veterans who've conquered worlds before. By year five, you're dealing with C-grade monsters who treat city-leveling spells like we treat lawn sprinklers.

The beautiful part is that the locals - that's you, congratulations - have exactly one job: stop them. All of them. Every single faction that's decided your world looks tasty. You need to either kill them all, subjugate them all, or somehow negotiate a deal that keeps your planet from becoming someone else's vacation home.

And these factions? They're not playing nice with each other either. While you're desperately trying to figure out which end of a cultivation manual is up, they're waging proxy wars across your continents. The Emerald Syndicate wants your mineral rights. The Void Traders want your dimensional stability. The Flesh Weavers just want somewhere they can practice their hobbies without the neighbors complaining about the screaming.

If you succeed - if somehow your Tutorial-graduated kindergarteners manage to out-fight, out-think, or out-negotiate entities with millennia of experience - then congratulations! You get a hundred years of protection to figure out how the hell you pulled that off.

If you fail? Well, the factions stop pretending to care about your feelings and just fight each other until someone wins. Your planet becomes a prize in someone else's game, your people become subjects in someone else's empire, and your entire civilization becomes a footnote in some multiversal history textbook.

The System watches all this with the detached interest of someone observing ants fight over a dropped ice cream cone. It doesn't care who wins - it just wants the conflict, the chaos, the beautiful entropy-preventing struggle that keeps the cosmic gears turning.

Ten years to prove you deserve to exist as an independent entity. Ten years to go from "barely knows magic exists" to "can negotiate with cosmic powers." Ten years to either ascend to the big leagues or become someone else's property.

The clock's ticking, and nobody's coming to help.
