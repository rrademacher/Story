Jake Hargrath - Pre-System Character Assessment
Subject evaluated 72 hours before planetary initiation protocols activated

Basic Intel
Name: Jacob "Jake" Hargrath
Age: 46
Height: 5'8" (because life's full of small disappointments)
Weight: 185 lbs (mostly spite and caffeine)
Occupation: IT Contractor / Professional Hermit
Location: Rural Virginia, population: him, three raccoons, and a neighbors' dog that keeps shitting on his lawn

Military Background
Branch: United States Marine Corps
Years of Service: 20 (1996-2016)
MOS: 0651 Cyber Network Systems Technician
Highest Rank: Staff Sergeant (E-6)
Discharge: Honorable (barely—turned down promotion to avoid more people-wrangling duties)

Combat Deployments:

Iraq (2003, 2005, 2007)
Afghanistan (2009, 2012)
Various "police actions" that officially never happened
Specializations:

Network security analysis
Equipment maintenance under fire
Converting military coffee into something resembling fuel
Tactical pessimism
Civilian Transition Disasters
Current Employment: Freelance IT contractor specializing in data recovery and system diagnostics. Works exclusively remote because conference calls are humanity's revenge on productivity.

Living Situation: 40-acre plot inherited from his uncle—a glorified hermit cave with fiber internet and enough solar panels to power a small dictatorship. Nearest neighbor is 2.3 miles away, which is still too close on most days.

Daily Routine:

0430: Wake up, curse existence
0500-0800: Coffee, news, more cursing
0800-1700: Remote work (cameras off, always)
1700-2100: Projects, maintenance, actual peace
2100-0100: Insomnia management via technical manuals
Neurological Profile
Social Processing: Operates on the "people are malfunctioning code" principle. Excellent at troubleshooting problems, terrible at troubleshooting humans. Conversations feel like debugging sessions where everyone else is using a different programming language.

Sensory Processing:

Hypersensitive to ambient noise (why crowds feel like acoustic torture)
Hyper-focused attention when interested (can disassemble electronics for 14 hours straight)
Texture sensitivity explains his uniform-adjacent wardrobe choices
Communication Style: Direct to the point of social violence. Sarcasm as primary language. Prefers written communication where tone can't be misinterpreted and people can't interrupt with their feelings.

Skills & Competencies
Technical Mastery:

Network architecture and penetration testing
Electronics repair and modification
Mechanical diagnostics (vehicles, generators, appliances)
Data analysis and pattern recognition
Improvised engineering solutions
Military Carryovers:

Small unit tactics and threat assessment
Weapons maintenance and marksmanship
Field improvisation and resource management
Stress response management (externally calm, internally screaming)
Leadership by example (when absolutely forced)
Soft Skills That Aren't:

Patience for machines: infinite
Patience for humans: approaching zero
Problem-solving under pressure
Working alone for extended periods without losing sanity
Translating technical concepts for civilians (reluctantly)
Psychological Landscape
Core Motivations:

Competence over chaos
Solitude over socialization
Function over form
Truth over comfort
Fears & Triggers:

Large crowds (sensory overload + unpredictable humans)
Incompetence masquerading as authority
Forced social performance and small talk
Systems failing when lives depend on them
Coping Mechanisms:

Routine as armor against unpredictability
Technical projects as meditation
Dark humor as emotional pressure valve
Physical distance as conflict prevention
Current Life Status
Financial: Stable enough to afford solitude and quality coffee beans. Owns his property outright, minimal debt, emergency fund that could sustain a small siege.

Physical Health: Better than most desk warriors half his age. Maintains military fitness standards out of habit and spite. Knees occasionally file formal complaints about past jumping-out-of-helicopters decisions.

Mental Health: Functional depression managed through structure, purpose, and aggressive boundary enforcement. Therapy via mechanical repair and long-distance shooting.

Social Network: Three people he doesn't actively want to murder:

Marcus (former squad mate, texts quarterly)
Sarah (sister, calls monthly, conversations last exactly 12 minutes)
Tony (hardware supplier, relationship purely transactional)
Pre-System Threat Assessment
Survival Probability: High, assuming the apocalypse comes with technical manuals and doesn't require group hugs.

Leadership Potential: Reluctant but capable—the kind of guy who'd organize a resistance cell purely to make it run efficiently, then disappear the moment victory speeches start.

Adaptability Rating: Excellent for environmental challenges, poor for social chaos. Will figure out alien technology before figuring out alien small talk.

Overall Classification: Lone Wolf Specialist—maximum effectiveness when minimum people are involved.

Note: Subject demonstrates classic signs of someone who joined the military to serve his country and stayed to avoid civilian awkwardness. The System's arrival will either kill him quickly or transform him into exactly the kind of competent, antisocial survivor that post-apocalyptic scenarios desperately need and absolutely don't deserve.
