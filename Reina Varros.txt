Reina Varros - Pre-System Psychological Assessment
Subject evaluated during routine truancy investigation, 96 hours before planetary classification upgrade

Basic Intel
Name: Reina Varros (pronounced "Ray-nah" because her dad couldn't even get the paperwork right)
Age: 12 (going on 40, trauma-wise)
Height: 4'9" (compact package of concentrated fury)
Weight: 78 lbs (mostly bones, spite, and unprocessed grief)
Hair: Blonde, waist-length, maintained like armor—the one thing nobody can take away
Eyes: Blue as winter sky, twice as cold
Current Status: Professional ghost haunting the margins of civilized society

Family Dysfunction Olympics
Father: Marcus Varros, 38, unemployed philosopher of applied alcoholism and creative parenting techniques. Believes children improve with percussive maintenance. Currently holds regional records in emotional neglect and creative excuse-making.

Mother: Jennifer Varros (deceased), died in car accident when Reina was 7. The universe's opening move in what would become a five-year masterclass in systematic childhood demolition.

Extended Family: Two grandparents who send Christmas cards to maintain plausible deniability about what happens in between holidays. Uncle Dave calls monthly, speaks to Marcus for exactly ninety seconds, pretends everything's fine.

Academic Warfare
School: Jefferson Middle School (attendance rate: optional)
Grade Level: Officially 7th, functionally post-graduate in survival studies
GPA: 3.9 when present, which is roughly never
Truancy Record: 47 unexcused absences this semester (personal best)

Intellectual Profile:

Reading comprehension: College level (escapism is excellent motivation)
Mathematical reasoning: Prodigy-adjacent (patterns are predictable, unlike humans)
Scientific method: Self-taught through necessity (hypothesis: pills make pain stop; conclusion: vomiting is nature's safety valve)
Social studies: Expert in power dynamics and resource scarcity
Teachers' Notes:

"Brilliant when engaged, invisible when not"
"Completes assignments weeks early or not at all"
"Makes other students uncomfortable with direct questions about mortality"
"Requested library access to medical texts—denied pending parent conference"
Survival Network
Primary Crash Pads:

Maya Chen (best friend, parents travel frequently)
Abandoned Blockbuster on Route 7 (roof access, functional Wi-Fi from neighboring Starbucks)
Construction site behind the mall (security shift change at 3 AM)
Public library basement (emergency use only, security cameras)
Resource Management:

Shoplifting success rate: 94% (small hands, smaller conscience)
Dumpster diving skills: Advanced (grocery stores waste premium food)
Cash reserves: $247 hidden in seven different locations
Emergency kit: Backpack with first aid, phone charger, three days' rations, pepper spray (stolen from Maya's mom)
Psychological Topography
Core Personality Traits:

Intelligence as weapon and shield
Hypervigilance disguised as antisocial behavior
Emotional walls built from recycled sarcasm and preemptive strikes
Trust issues that could be seen from orbit
Survival Mechanisms:

Invisibility: Perfected the art of occupying space without existing
Intellectual superiority: Can't hurt what you can't understand
Emotional numbing: Pain is temporary, smart is forever
Strategic isolation: Leave before being left
Interpersonal Dysfunction:

Adults: All potential threats until proven otherwise
Peers: Generally too stupid or too innocent to relate to
Authority figures: The enemy wearing helpful masks
Maya: The exception that proves human beings can occasionally not suck
The Incident (Six Months Ago)
Date: March 15th (Ides of Marcus, historically appropriate)
Method: Ibuprofen overdose (raided medicine cabinet, took 47 tablets)
Duration: 6 hours of violent vomiting, 12 hours of unconsciousness
Discovery: Marcus found her, briefly achieved sobriety through panic
Aftermath: Two weeks of fake concern, one therapy session, return to regularly scheduled programming

Lessons Learned:

Liver is surprisingly resilient to amateur chemistry
Vomiting is the body's way of refusing bad decisions
Marcus's guilt lasts exactly 96 hours before converting back to resentment
Internet research beats impulse when planning exits
Current Operational Status
Physical Health: Chronically malnourished, vitamin deficient, but surprisingly durable. Immune system strengthened by exposure to every pathogen in three counties.

Mental Health: Functional depression managed through intellectual pursuits and controlled dissociation. Suicidal ideation exists as background noise rather than active planning—death seems redundant when life already feels posthumous.

Daily Routine:

0630: Wake up (if at home), assess threat level
0730: Skip breakfast (if available), skip school (always)
0800-1500: Library internet, abandoned buildings, or Maya's house
1500-1800: Avoid home until Marcus reaches peak intoxication
1800-2200: Homework (when safe), research (always)
2200+: Sleep wherever feels least dangerous
Skills & Competencies
Academic Excellence:

Speed reading (books are faster than reality)
Research methodology (survival depends on information)
Pattern recognition (predicting adult behavior prevents bruises)
Written communication (words don't fight back)
Street Skills:

Urban camouflage and situational awareness
Lock picking (YouTube University, graduated summa cum laude)
Petty theft with plausible deniability
Emergency first aid (treating your own injuries builds character)
Survival Psychology:

Threat assessment and de-escalation
Resource conservation and procurement
Long-term planning despite short-term chaos
Emotional compartmentalization
Social Landscape
Relationship Status: Professionally single (trust is expensive, intimacy is hazardous)

Best Friend: Maya Chen—the statistical anomaly who proves not all humans are garbage. Relationship based on mutual weirdness and Maya's supernatural ability to smuggle snacks past adult radar.

Adult Allies: Mrs. Henderson (librarian) who pretends not to notice irregular hours and never asks why a twelve-year-old needs medical journals. Mr. Peterson (night security) who "doesn't see" certain people accessing certain buildings after hours.

Known Threats: Marcus (primary), truancy officers (secondary), well-meaning guidance counselors (tertiary but persistent).

Pre-System Assessment
Survival Probability: Unexpectedly high—has been running beta tests on apocalyptic scenarios for five years. Already knows how to find food, shelter, and safety when official systems fail.

Leadership Potential: Negative interest in leading, maximum potential for strategic advisory roles. Will identify problems and solutions, leave implementation to someone else's poor judgment.

Adaptability Rating: Excellent—has learned to treat reality as negotiable and adults as unreliable. Will approach cosmic horror with the same pragmatic skepticism currently applied to school administrators.

Psychological Resilience: Paradoxically strong—having survived systematic childhood destruction, interdimensional invasion feels like Tuesday with better special effects.

System Integration Forecast: High probability of treating Tutorial dungeons as improvement over current living conditions. May actually thank cosmic overlords for upgraded housing arrangements.

Clinical Note: Subject represents textbook case of "feral genius"—intellectual development accelerated by environmental stressors, social development stunted by betrayal trauma. The System's arrival may provide first stable authority structure subject has encountered. Recommend monitoring for signs of Stockholm syndrome toward alien overlords, though honestly, they can't be worse than her current guardians.

Addendum: Subject's combination of analytical intelligence, survival experience, and complete lack of investment in status quo makes her ideal candidate for post-apocalyptic adaptation. Society's loss will be the multiverse's gain.
