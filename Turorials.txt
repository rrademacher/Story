The Tutorial Stage - ah yes, the System's equivalent of freshman orientation, except instead of awkward icebreakers and campus tours, you get teleported into purpose-built murder mazes designed to separate the future cultivation gods from the future fertilizer.

Picture this: one moment you're arguing about your mortgage payment or complaining that your latte isn't hot enough, and the next moment you're standing in some impossible space that smells like ozone and existential dread, surrounded by strangers who look just as confused and significantly more likely to die horribly in the next twelve months.

Now here's where it gets interesting - not every faction running these tutorial dungeons is staffed by sadistic psychopaths. Some of them actually read the parenting books, metaphorically speaking. The Scholarly Concordat, for instance, runs tutorials that look more like magical universities than gladiator pits. Their dungeons are filled with libraries, training halls, and meditation gardens where the biggest danger is paper cuts from ancient tomes or falling asleep during a particularly boring lecture on mana circulation theory.

These educational paradises are staffed by beings who've transcended the need to prove their worth through violence and have instead dedicated their immortal existence to teaching others how to not die spectacularly. They provide structured lessons, proper equipment, healing facilities, and something approaching actual mentorship. Students advance through carefully designed challenges that test competence rather than willingness to bathe in the blood of their enemies.

But then you have the other end of the spectrum - factions like the Crimson Collective, who believe that the only proper education involves watching your best friend's intestines paint the walls while you learn to channel your first fireball through pure, unadulterated terror. Their dungeons are basically reality TV death matches with a thin veneer of "character building" smeared over the carnage.

The beautiful irony? Both approaches work. The gentle scholars produce thoughtful, well-rounded cultivators who understand theory and can build sustainable power bases. The blood-soaked murder schools produce survivors with the kind of sharp-edged pragmatism that comes from learning that hesitation equals disembowelment.

The System doesn't give a shit which approach you prefer - it just wants results. Some humans thrive in the supportive academic environment, carefully climbing from G to E grade through diligent study and measured practice. Others need to have their survival instincts beaten into them with clubs made from the bones of previous failures.

And here's the real kicker - the factions know this too. They're not just randomly picking pedagogical approaches; they're deliberately targeting different personality types, different cultures, different psychological profiles. The faction that sponsors your tutorial looked at your little corner of Earth and made a calculated decision about whether you needed a library card or a body count to reach your potential.

The System's greatest joke? No matter which path you take, you still end up in the same place - either dead, or powerful enough to wish you were.
