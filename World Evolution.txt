Ah, seeded worlds - the System's little terrarium projects, each one a carefully cultivated petri dish of suffering and ambition. You want to know the beautiful, horrifying truth? Every blade of grass, every microbe, every sentient being capable of existential dread was placed there with the loving care of a cosmic gardener who waters their plants with blood and fertilizes with crushed dreams.

The System doesn't just throw life at random rocks and hope something sticks. No, that would be inefficient, and if there's one thing the System abhors more than entropy, it's waste. Every seeded world is a deliberate experiment in evolutionary pressure - a multi-billion-year slow cooker designed to tenderize civilizations until they're ready for the real meat grinder.

Think about it: your cute little blue marble, with its adorable wars and charming genocides, was essentially the System's way of breeding fighting dogs. Except instead of dogs, it's breeding entire species, and instead of fighting other dogs, they're eventually going to be thrown into a multiversal cage match where the winners get to live long enough to maybe, just maybe, transcend mortality itself.

Because here's the kicker - Grade A isn't the ceiling. It's just where the System stops holding your hand and starts betting on whether you'll become something that makes gods look like particularly ambitious ants. The System has been playing this game for eons, seeding world after world, watching civilizations rise and fall like foam on beer, all in the hopes that somewhere, somehow, one of these meat puppets will crack the code and become something genuinely unprecedented.

Every tutorial dungeon graduate who thinks they're hot shit for making it to E-grade? They're not students - they're lottery tickets. The System bought quadrillions of them, scattered them across reality, and is waiting to see which ones might eventually pay out with something that transcends even its own understanding.

The real joke? Most seeded worlds never even make it past their Incursion stage. They get gobbled up by existing factions, their potential harvested like organs from the recently deceased. But that's fine by the System - failure teaches lessons too, and those lessons get folded back into the design of the next batch of worlds.

It's agricultural on a scale that would make Monsanto weep with envy, if Monsanto dealt in souls instead of soybeans.
